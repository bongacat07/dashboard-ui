# Svelte Project

A simple static UI prototype for our hackathon ðŸš€

## Prerequisites
- Either **Bun** (recommended) or **Node.js + npm** installed. Bun and npm are both package managers to install all the libraries and dependencies you'll need. I personally, use Bun since it's way faster than npm and would recommend bun, but if you want to go ahead with nom, yarn or pnpm, totally fine. 

### Option 1: Install Bun (recommended)
- macOS / Linux:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
- Windows
```bash
 powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
bun --version 
```
Run this command to check if the installation is complete.

## Setup Instructions

 **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bongacat07/dashboard-ui.git
   cd dashboard-ui
   bun install
   bun run dev --open
   ```
